Vuk’uzenzele4May 2022 Edition 2HEALTHProtect yourself from COVID-19 before winterAllison CooperWith South Africa’s COVID-19 cases increasing ahead of the predicted fifth wave and cold winter months around the corner, government con-tinues to urge the public to get vaccinated against the virus and stay up to date with their booster shots.
According to Health Minister Dr Joe Phaahla, on 25 April South Africa recorded a 137% increase in new COVID-19 cases, compared with the previous seven days, driven mainly by higher rates of infection in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape.
“COVID-19 remains a threat and we cannot afford to drop all prevention measures,” said Minister Phaahla.
“We again urge all those who are still not vaccinated to come forward and take the jab. We are still under 50% of adults with at least one jab and that’s not good.
We urge young adults to come forward. Natural immunity wanes after time and unlike vaccination, it cannot be booked. We urge all those who qualify for boosters to take the opportunity before deep winter,” he added.
The Western Cape Department of Health says local and international data prove that vaccination against COVID-19 remains the best defence against the virus. This is even more so for people who have a compromised immune system.
COVID-19 will not go away anytime soon. To defeat it, we must eradicate it by ensuring that as many people as possible are vaccinated and continue to have their booster shots, the department said. The fifth waveEven though COVID-19 cases are increasing and the country is expecting to soon be in the fifth wave, it is not yet known how severe it will be.
“What is still uncertain is that our scientists tell us that a new wave will come through a new variant nicknamed Pi, which will need to be more transmissible and escape immunity.
But, at this stage, what is confirmed to be dominant are sub-variants of Omicron called B.4 and B.5,” said Phaahla. Prevent transmissionYou can help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 by ensuring: • That your COVID-19 vaccinations (including booster shots) are up to date.
• That indoor spaces are well ventilated.
• Wearing a face mask when indoors and in crowded spaces.
• That you get the flu vaccine.
• That you know what to do when you have flulike symptoms.
• That you wash your hands and sanitise.

Getting your annual flu vaccination is the most effective way to protect yourself against flu and serious complications, says the Western Cape Delft Community Health Centre’s dietician, Tanja Venter.
She said you can also help your body to fight off infections by eating a well-balanced diet that includes lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.
“If you do catch a cold or the flu, having a streng thened immune system can help to reduce the severity of symptoms and the period of illness,” she adds.
While no single food item can guarantee immunity against colds and flu, Venter says food rich in antioxidants can boost the immune system by ensuring that immune cells work optimally.
“Including butternut, pumpkin, citrus fruits (oranges), tomatoes, whole grains, milk and lean meats, and drinking lots of clean water can contribute to a healthier immune system, keeping colds and flu at bay.”For infants and toddlers, up to the age of two, Venter says breastfeeding provides them with the best start to a healthy immune system.
Reduce stressOther ways to ensure a healthy immune system include monitoring your well-being and stress levels.
Venter explains that longterm stress can affect the immune system, making the body vulnerable to infections.
“With the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, we often find ourselves stres sed out, eating poorly and not doing enough exercise.
Exercising can reduce stress and improve overall health,” says Venter.You can also decrease stress by doing something that helps you unwind, such as drawing, painting, sewing, writing or cooking.  “Other healthy habits for adults and children include good hygiene practices, such as washing your hands regularly, coug hing or sneezing into a tissue or elbow and staying home when you are sick to avoid infecting others,” says Venter.
Visit your local clinic to get your flu vaccine, or for a check-up, if you develop any of the common flu symptoms, including a headache, fever or body chills, sore throat or cough (usually dry), tiredness and weakness, a runny or stuffy nose, aching muscles and vomiting, diarrhoea and high fever (common in children).
