Vuk’uzenzele4Nhlaba 2022 Ushicilelo 2EZEMPILOZivikele kwiCOVID-19  ngaphambi kobusika  Allison CooperNjengoba izigameko zeCOVID-19 eNingizimu A frika zilokhu zikhuphuka ngaphambi kwehlandla lesihlanu eliqaguliwe kanye nezinyanga ezibandayo zobusika esezisemome, uhulumeni uyaqhubeka nokunxusa umphakathi ukuthi ugomele igciwane futhi ungasaleli emuva ngemijovo yokuvuselela.
Ngokusho kukaNgqongqoshe Wezempilo uDkt. Joe Phaahla, mhla zingama-25 kuMbasa iNingizimu Afrika yaqopha ukukhula kwezigameko ezintsha zeCOVID-19 ngama-137%, uma kuqhathaniswa nezinsuku eziyisikhombisa ezedlule, okuholwa kakhulu ngamazinga aphezulu okusuleleka ezifundazweni zase-Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natali kanye naseNtshonalanga Kapa.
“ICOVID-19 isalokhu iyingozi futhi ngeke sikwazi ukuyekela zonke izindlela zokuyivikela," kusho uNgqongqoshe uPhaahla.
“Siyaphinda futhi sinxusa bonke labo abangakagomi ukuthi beze bezogoma.
Sisalokhu singaphansi kwama-50% wabantu abadala asebethole okungenani umjovo owodwa kanti lokho akukuhle neze.
Sinxusa intsha esikhulile ukuthi isondele. Ukuqina kwamasotsha omzimba ngokwemvelo kuyafadalala  ngokuhamba kwesikhathi futhi akufani nokugoma, ngeke ukubekele isikhathi. Sinxusa bonke labo abafanelekile ukuthola umjovo wokuvuselela ukuthi basebenzise leli thuba kungakafiki ubusika," kwengeza yena.
UMnyango Wezempilo eNtshonalanga Kapa uthi imininingwane yalapha kuleli lizwe neyasemhlabeni jikelele iqinisekisa ukuthi ukugomela iCOVID-19 kusalokhu kuyisona sikhali  esihamba phambili ekulweni negciwane. Lokhu kusiza kakhulu kubantu abanamasotsha omzimba abuthakathaka.
ICOVID-19 angeke inyamalale maduze nje.
Ukuze inqotshwe, kufanele siyiqede ngokuqinisekisa ukuthi kugoma abantu abaningi futhi siqhubeke nokuthola imijovo yokuvuselela, kusho umnyango.
Ihlandla lesihlanuYize izigameko zeCOVID-19 zikhula futhi izwe lilindele ukuthi maduze lingene ehlandleni lesihlanu, akukaziwa ukuthi lizoba libi kangakanani.
“Okungakaqinisekiswa yilokho esikutshelwa ngososayensi bethu ukuthi umxhantela wegciwane omusha uzofika ngomxha ntela omusha oteketiswa ngelikaPi, ozofuna ukusabalala ngesivinini futhi wehlule namasotsha omzimba aqinile. Kodwa kulesi sigaba, osekuqinisekisiwe ukuthi yikhona  okudlangile yimixhantela yegciwane iOmicron ebizwa nge-B.4 ne-B.5," kusho uPhaahla.
Gwema ukusulelanaUngasiza ukugwema ukusulelana ngeCOVID-19 ngokuqinisekisa:
• Ukuthi awushiywa isikhathi ekuthatheni imigomo yakho yeCOVID-19 kanye nemijovo yokuvuselela.
•  Ukuthi izindawo zangaphakathi zingenisa umoya ngokwanele.
•  Ukuthi ugqoka isifonyo uma ungaphakathi kwesakhiwo kanye nasezindaweni ezigcwele abantu.
•  Ukuthi ugomela umkhuhlane.
•  Ukuthi uyazi kumele wenzeni uma unezimpawu ezifana nezomkhuhlane.
•  Ukuthi uhlanza izandla zakho futhi usebenzisa izibulali-magciwane.

Getting your annual flu vaccination is the most effective way to protect yourself against flu and serious complications, says the Western Cape Delft Community Health Centre’s dietician, Tanja Venter.
She said you can also help your body to fight off infections by eating a well-balanced diet that includes lots of fresh fruit  and vegetables.
“If you do catch a cold or the flu, having a strengthened immune system can help to reduce the severity of symptoms and the period of illness,” she adds.
While no single food item can guarantee immunity against colds and flu, Venter says food rich in antioxidants can boost the immune system by ensuring that immune cells work optimally.
“Including butternut, pumpkin, citrus fruits (oranges), tomatoes, whole grains, milk and lean meats, and drinking lots of clean water can contribute to a  healthier immune system, keeping colds and flu at bay.”For infants and toddlers, up to the age of two, Venter says breastfeeding provides them with the best start to a healthy immune system.
Reduce stressOther ways to ensure a healthy immune system include monitoring your well-being and stress  levels.
Venter explains that longterm stress can affect the immune system, making the body vulnerable to infections.
“With the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, we often find ourselves stressed out, eating poorly and not doing enough exercise.
Exercising can reduce stress and improve overall health,” says Venter. You can also decrease stress by doing something that helps you unwind, such as drawing, painting, sewing, writing or cooking.  “Other healthy habits for adults and children include good hygiene practices, such as washing your hands regularly, coug hing or sneezing into a tissue or elbow and staying home when you are sick to avoid infecting others,” says Venter.
Visit your local clinic to get your flu vaccine, or for a check-up, if you develop any of the common flu symptoms, including a headache, fever or body chills, sore throat or cough (usually dry), tiredness and weakness, a runny or stuffy nose, aching muscles and vomiting, diarrhoea and high fever (common in children).
