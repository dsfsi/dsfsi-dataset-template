Distributed by:Printed by:CACH connects students with learning opportunitiesSilusapho NyandaYoung people who have not yet secured spots at higher education institutions can turn to the Central Application Clearing House (CACH) system for help.
  CACH is an online government service managed by the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET). The service helps those who need access to university, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) colleges and skills development opportunities.
 “CACH services have been available from 24 January 2022, and will close on 31 March, to assist those who need to enter tertiary education but face challenges with getting space,” says Minister of Higher Education and Training Dr Blade Nzimande. CACH can help those who applied for admission to a university or a college on time in 2021, but were not offered a place in a programme of their choice.
  The DHET explained that this usually happens when the applicant does not meet the necessary requirements or the institution has reached its limit on the number of students it can enrol.
CACH can also help those who applied to a higher learning institution and were accepted, but now want to change their courses.
 CACH will refer individuals to career development services and where possible, provide an opportunity for them to be considered for spaces still available at universities, TVET colleges or Sector Education and Training Authority (SETA) learnerships, without having to travel to any institution. All public universities, TVET colleges and SETAs can access the CACH database to search for individuals who meet the criteria for available spaces.
“Institutions select individuals from the CACH database and make direct contact with those they have selected,” says DHET spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi.
 Applicants who sign up for CACH must submit their details, including their preferred fields of study.
Applicants have options to accept or reject study offers on the CACH system.
Institutions of higher learning will only be able to access applicants’ information from CACH once applicants have signed up and uploaded their Grade 12 results. Mnisi says CACH also helps prospective students who are undecided about career choices by referring them to DHET’s Khetha Career Development Service.
 

 weaknesses identified by the SIU investigation, the President explained.
Action taken Since the start of the investigation, the SIU, working with other agencies, has made the following progress:
• 45 matters, with a combined value of R2.1 billion, have been enrolled with the Special Tribunal on Corruption, Fraud and Illicit Money Flows. The spe-cial tribunal has a statutory mandate to recover public funds stolen through corruption, fraud and illicit money flows, and take civil action against perpetrators;• 224 cases have been referred for disciplinary action against officials in government departments or entities;• 386 cases have been referred to the NPA, and three have been referred for executive action;• 330 cases have been referred for administrative action, which includes blacklisting (not being able to do work for gov ernment).
According to the report, a total of R551.5 million (value of cash and assets) is to be recovered, while R34.2 million has been recovered to date.
The investigation prevented a R114.2 million loss, and set contracts aside valued at R170.4 million.
The SIU expects these matters to be completed between March and April 2022, before the submission of a supplementary report to the President at the end of June.The report does not include details of ongoing investigations into allega tions received by the SIU after the deadline set for the final report.
These include investigations into 476 service providers, linked to 964 contracts, valued at more than R961.6 million.
The outcomes of these investigations, the Presidency said, will also be provided in the June report.
The President thanked the SIU for the work done in the past 18 months, and also whistle-blowers and other witnesses who provided information to investigators.
