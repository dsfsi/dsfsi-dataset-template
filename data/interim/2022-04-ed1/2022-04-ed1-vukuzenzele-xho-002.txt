HEALTHVuk’uzenzele 11 EkaTshazimpunzi 2022  Ushicilelo 1Konke okufuneka ukwazi malunga nesathuthwaneAbantu abaninzi  abanesathu thwane banokuphila ubomi obuqhelekileyo ukuba basela amayeza abo kwaye imeko ilawulwa kakuhle.
Ngokokutsho kukaGqirha Nhlakanipho Gumede, onguMphathi wezoNyango weeNkonzo zoNyango kwisibhedlele soMmandla i-Harry Gwala eMgungu ndlovu, isathuthwane akusikokuphazamiseka ngokwasengqondweni, sisifo okanye sisigulo, kwaye asosuleli.
Uchaza ukuba isathu thwane kukuphazamiseka kwemithambo-luvo okubonakaliswa zizehlo eziphindaphindanayo zesiquphe zokuphazamiseka kweemvakalelo, ukulahlekelwa yingqondo okanye ukuxhuzula, okunxulumene nomsebenzi wombane ongaqhelekanga engqondweni.
“Ingqondo yenziwa ziibhiliyoni zeeseli zemi thambo-luvo (iineuron) ezinxibelelana ngeempawu zombane kunye nemichiza.
Xa kukho ukukhutshwa kombane okugqithisileyo ngokukhawuleza okuphazamisa umsebenzi oqhelekileyo weeseli zemithambo-luvo, kunokubangela ukuxhuzula.
“Ukuxhuzula nje kube kanye akuthethi ukuba unesathuthwane. Ukuxilongwa ngugqirha kufuneka kuqini sekise oku,” utshilo.
NgokoMbutho weSathuthwane eMzantsi Afrika, ama-80% wabantu abanesathuthwane banakho ukulawula ukuxhuzula kwabo ngamayeza.
Iimbangela kunye nokuxhuzulaUnobangela wesathu thwane kubantu abathandathu kwabalishumi awukaziwa.  Kubantu abangama-40%, sinokubangelwa kukwenzakala kwentloko, ukwenzakala ngexesha lokubeleka, ukusetyenziswa kakubi kotywala kunye neziyobisi, ukuguga okanye ukuphazamiseka okanye ukungalingani ekwakhekeni komzimba okanye iikhemikhali emzimbeni.
UGqr Gumede uthi iimpawu zesathuthwane ziyahluka, kwaye zinokubonakala ngeendlela ezahlukeneyo, kuquka ukuxhuzula okubizwa ngegeneralised absence seizures (ipetit mal), xa umntu ebonakala ngathi uhanjelwe ingqondo kwaye ethe phuhlu amehlo; ukuxhuzula okubizwa ngetonic-clonic seizures (igrand mal), edla ngokuqala ngokuqina komzimba, ngaphambi kokuba umntu awe phantsi aze abeneentshukumo zokuxhuzula; kunye noku xhuzula okuyicomplex partial seizures, okuchaphazela icala lengqondo.
Ukuxhuzula okubizwa ngepetit mal kuthatha imizuzwana embalwa, kwaye umntu usenokungazi ukuba unako. Ngexesha lokuxhuzula okubizwa ngegrand mal, umntu unokuba nombala oluhlaza okwesibhakabhaka emlonyeni wakhe, othi uphele xa ukuphefumla okuqhelekileyo kuqalisa kwakhona.
Ukuxhuzula kwegrand mal kudla ngokuthatha imizuzu embalwa.
“Khusela umntu ekwe nzakaleni ngokubeka izinto kude kwaye uthintele intloko yakhe. Musa uku thintela intshukumo yabo okanye ukubeka nantoni na emlonyeni wabo. Mncede ukuba aphefumle ngokumlalisa umntu ngecala xa ukuxhuzula kuphela. Hlala nalo mntu ade achache ngokupheleleyo.”Ngexesha lokuxhuzula okubizwa ngecomplex partial seizure, umntu unokubonakala edidekile, ephazamisekile okanye enxilile. Basenokuba nee ntshukumo eziphindaphi ndayo, njengokugqogqa iimpahla zabo. “Susa izinto eziyingozi kwaye umkhokhele umntu kude nengozi. Thetha ngokuzolileyo kwaye ubaqinisekise,” utshilo uGqr Gumede.* Iinkcukacha zinikezelwe liSebe lezeMpilo KwaZulu-Natal.
