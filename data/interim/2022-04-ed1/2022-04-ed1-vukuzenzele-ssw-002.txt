HEALTHVuk’uzenzele 11 Mabasa 2022  Lushicilelo 1Konkhe lodzinga kukwati mayelana nesitfutfwaneBantfu labanyenti labanesitfutfwane bangatiphilela imphilo letayelekile uma ngabe banatsa imitsi yabo baphindze futsi balawule simo sabo kahle.
Ngekusho kwaDkt.
Nhlakanipho Gumede, Umphatsi Wetinsita Tetekwelashwa eSibhedlela Sesigodzi i-Harry Gwala ePietermaritzburg, sitfu tfwane akusiko kungasebenti kahle kwengcondvo, sifo noma kugula, kantsi futsi asitselelwana.
Uchaze watsi sitfutfwa ne kungasebenti kahle kwemiva lokubonakala ngetehlakalo tekuphatamiseka kwemiva letivele-nje tenteke njalonjalo, kucaleka noma kunklinklita uchwishe, lokuhambisana netenteko tagezi engco ndvweni letingakatayeleki.
“Ingcondvo inetigidzi gidzi tetinhlayinhlayi temiva (emaneurons) lachumana ngetinkhomba tagezi nemakhemikhali. Uma ngabe kwenteka kukhululeka gezi longetulu kwelizinga lelifanele lophatamisa kusebenta lokwetayelekile kwetinhlayinhlayi temiva, umuntfu angacaleka.
“Kucaleka kanye akusho kutsi unesitfutfwane. Lucilongo lolwentiwa sisebenti setekwelashwa sifanele sikucinisekise loku,” kusho yena.
Ngekuya kwesikhungo seteSitfutfwane SaseNingizimu Afrika, ema-80% webantfu labanesitfutfwane batawukhona kulawula kucaleka kwabo ngekusebentisa umutsi.
Timbangela kanye nekucalekaTimbangela tesitfutfwane kubantfu labasitfupha kulabalishumi atatiwa.
Kulabanye labangema-40%, singabangelwa kulimala kwenhloko, kulimala nawubelekwa, tjwala nekusebentisa tidzakamiva budlabha, kuguga noma  kugayeka kwekudla kube ngemandla emtimbeni noma-ke kuphatamiseka noma inchubo yemakhemikhali emtimbeni nekungasimami kweluhlelo lwemtimba.
Dkt. Gumede utsi timphawu netinkhomba tesitfutfwane tiyehlukahlukana, kantsi futsi tingatetfula ngetindlela letinyenti letehlukahlukene, kufaka ekhatsi kucaleka lokubitwa ngeabsence seizures (ipetit mal), umuntfu abukeka alahlekile ngekwengcondvo abuke ndzawonye; kucaleka lokubitwa ngetonic-clonic (igrand mal), lokucala ngekoma nekucina kwemtimba, ngembi kwekutsi umuntfu awe bese uyanklinklita; kanye nekucaleka lokubitwa ngecomplex partial seizures, lokutsikameta incenye yengcondvo.
Kucaleka kweluhlobo lwepetit mal kutsatsa emasekhondi lambalwa, kantsi futsi loyo muntfu  logulako kungenteka angacapheli nekucaphela kutsi uhlaselekile. Ngesikhatsi sekucaleka kwegrand mal, loyo muntfu lohlaselekile angaba nembala losasibhakabhaka kutungeleta umlomo wakhe, lobese kuyaphela uma acala kuphefumula ngalokwetayelekile. Kucaleka kwegrand mal kuvamise kutsatsa imizuzu lembalwa.
“Vikela umuntfu logulako ekulimaleni ngekutsi ususe tintfo letidvutane naye bese ucamelisa kahle inhloko yakhe. Ungakukhinyabeti kuhamba kwakhe noma-ke nifake nanoma yini emlonyeni wakhe. Sita lomuntfu aphefumule ngekutsi umlalise ngemhlubulo uma aphaphama kulokucaleka.
Hlala nalomuntfu kute uba ngulapho tingcondvo tabo tibuya ngalokuphelele.”Ngesikhatsi sekuculeka kweluhlobo lwecomplex partial seizure, lomuntfu angabukeka adidekile, aphatamisekile noma adzakiwe. Bangaphindze futsi babe neminyakato lephindzaphindzekako, njengekudvosa timphahla tabo. “Susa tintfo letingabanga ingoti bese uyamsita lomuntfu umsusa engotini.
Khuluma ngalokupholile uphindze futsi ubacinisekise,” kusho Dkt. Gumede.

The imbizo was held recently in Mmabatho Sta dium in the Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality  where scores of residents had gathered.
President Ramaphosa interacted with people and listened to their experiences of daily life in the province, service delivery challenges as well as their initiatives and solutions to improve socio-econom ic conditions.

The President told the community members that he had heard their cries and that government will  be focusing more on service delivery.
“We had a very fruitful session with the community … the residents were able to raise their concerns and complaints but they also put suggestions forward, and what we need to do better, so I  found it very enriching.
“We are going to be fo cusing more and more on service delivery. Many of the issues that were raised were of a service delivery nature, there was so much enthusiasm that nearly all of them wanted to speak,” the President said.
President Ramaphosa said it had been great to hear people speaking openly and freely as this is what enriches democracy.
The Imbizo also provided an opportunity to inspire new thinking, different ideas, and sug gestions on how to fix the challenges that exist.
“I am grateful that the Ministers were present and were able to respond to many of the issues that have been raised.”He said the District Development Model was moving into top gear. “We are going to be utilising it more and more so that as the government we stop working in silos, we must work together in an integrated way.
“I am very pleased that most of the replies that were given here are a clear demonstration that we are now becoming more and more integrated and we are going to address the challenges that our people have faced.”  The President told the community members that government will focus more on service delivery and the Ministers would return to the area with a number of programmes focusing on what needs to be done.– SAnews.gov.za
