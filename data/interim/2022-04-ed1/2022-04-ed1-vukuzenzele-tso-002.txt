U hlamusela leswaku switshetshela i ntshikelelo wa misiha lowu tikombaka hi ku cinca ka nkarhi na nkarhi ka swiphemu swa nkavanyeto wa misiha, ku titivala kumbe ku hahama, loku fambisanaka ni swendlo swa matimba leswi nga tolovelekangiki ebyongweni.
“Byongo byi endliwe hi tibiliyoni ta tisele ta misiha  (tinyuroni) leti burisanaka hi matimba ni swikoweto swa khemikhali. Loko ku va ni mphakelo wa xihatla wo tlula mpimo wa matimba lowu kavanyetaka matirhelo ya ntolovelo ya tisele ta misiha, swi nga ha vanga ku tlumberiwa ehansi.
 “Ku tlumberiwa kan’we ehansi a swi vuli leswaku hakunene u ni switshetshela. Ku kumiwa ka vuvabyi hi mutivi wa swa vutshunguri swi fanele ku swi tiyisisa,” a vula tano.
Hi ku ya hi Nhlangano wa Switshetshela wa AfrikaDzonga, 80% ta vanhu lava nga ni switshetshela va nga swi kota ku lawula ku tlumberiwa ka vona ehansi hi ku tirhisa mirhi.
Swivangelo ni ku tlumberiwa ehansiXivangelo xa switshetshela eka tsevu exikarhi ka vanhu va khume a xi tiveki. Eka 40% leyin’wana, swi nga vangiwa hi ku vaviseka ka nhloko, ku vaviseka hi nkarhi wo velekiwa, ku tirhisa xihoko ni swidzi dziharisi hi ndlela yobiha, ku kula kumbe ku cinca ka miri kumbe nkavanyeto wa bayokhemikali kumbe ku ka u nga tsakanga emirini.
Dok Gumede u vula leswaku swilemukiso ni swikombiso swa switshetshela swa hambana, naswona swi nga tikombisa hi tindlela to hambanahambana, ku katsa ku tlumberiwa ehansi hi ku angarhela (phethithi male), loko munhu a languteka a nga ha titivi kutani a honokile; ku tlumberiwa ehansi hi ku angarhela hikwalaho ka thoniki-kliloniki (girandi male), leswi hi ntolovelo swi sungulaka hi ku sihalala ka miri, munhu a nga si wela ehansi kutani a hlalahlala; ni ku tlumberiwa ehansi ka xinkadyana ko tika, loku khumbaka xiphemu xo karhi xa byongo. Ku tlumberiwa ehansi ka phethithi male ku teka tisekondi tingaritingani ntsena, naswona munhu a nga ka a nga ha swi lemuki leswaku a tlumberiwe ehansi. EKa nkarhi wo tlumberiwa ehansi wa girandi male, munhu a nga va ni muhlovo wa wasi enon’wini wa yena, lowu hangalakaka loko a tlhela a sungula ku hefemula.
Ku tlumberiwa ehansi ka girandi male mikarhi yotala ku teka timinetse tingaritingani.
 “Sirhelela munhu eka ku vaviseka hi ku susa swingolongondzwana ekusuhi na yena ni ku seketela nhloko ya yena. U nga siveli ku tshukunyuka ka yena kumbe ku hoxa nchumu endzeni ka nomo wa yena.
Pfuna munhu ku hefemula hi ku n’wi lata hi rivambu loko ku tlumberiwa ehansi ku hela. Tshama ni munhu yoloye ku kondza a xalamuka hi ku hetiseka.
Eka ku tlumberiwa ehansi ko tika ka xinkadyana,  munhu a nga tikomba a hlangananile, a hlangane nhloko kumbe ku pyopyiwa. Swi nga endleka a tshukunyukatshukunya, tanihi ku dlurhula mpahla ya yena. “Susa swingolongondzwana leswi nga ni khombo kutani u hundzu luxela munhu yoloye ekule ni khombo. Vulavula khwatsi ni ku n’wi khongotela,” ku vula Dok Gumede.* Mahungu ya rhumeriwile hi Ndzawulo ya Rihanyu ya KwaZulu-NatalKu kuma mahungu hi xitalo mayelana ni switshetshela, endzela webusayiti ya Epilepsy SA eka https://epilepsy.

ANGARHELOPresident concludes North West Imbizo on a high notePresident Cyril Ramaphosa has described his Presidential Imbizo in the North West province as a success after holding a fruitful session with community members.
The imbizo was held recently in Mmabatho Sta dium in the Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality  where scores of residents had gathered.
President Ramaphosa interacted with people and listened to their experiences of daily life in the province, service delivery challenges as well as their initiatives and solutions to improve socio-econom ic conditions.
The President was flanked by a number of his Cabinet Ministers, including Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi, Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele, Minister of Tourism Lindiwe Sisulu, Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu and Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe, among others.
The President told the community members that he had heard their cries and that government will  be focusing more on service delivery.
“We had a very fruitful session with the community … the residents were able to raise their concerns and complaints but they also put suggestions forward, and what we need to do better, so I  found it very enriching.
“We are going to be fo cusing more and more on service delivery. Many of the issues that were raised were of a service delivery nature, there was so much enthusiasm that nearly all of them wanted to speak,” the President said.
President Ramaphosa said it had been great to hear people speaking openly and freely as this is what enriches democracy.
The Imbizo also provided an opportunity to inspire new thinking, different ideas, and sug gestions on how to fix the challenges that exist.
“I am grateful that the Ministers were present and were able to respond to many of the issues that have been raised.”He said the District Development Model was moving into top gear. “We are going to be utilising it more and more so that as the government we stop working in silos, we must work together in an integrated way.
“I am very pleased that most of the replies that were given here are a clear demonstration that we are now becoming more and more integrated and we are going to address the challenges that our people have faced.”  The President told the community members that government will focus more on service delivery and the Ministers would return to the area with a number of programmes focusing on what needs to be done.– SAnews.gov.za
