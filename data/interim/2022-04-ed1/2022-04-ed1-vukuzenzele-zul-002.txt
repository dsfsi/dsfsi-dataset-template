HEALTHVuk’uzenzele 11 Mbasa 2022 Ushicilelo 1Konke okumele ukwazi ngesithuthwaneAbantu abaningi abanesithuthwane bangaphila impilo eyejwayelekile uma bephuza imithi yabo futhi belawula kahle lesi simo.
Ngokusho kuka-Dkt Nhlakanipho Gumede, onguMphathi Womtho lampilo kweZokwelashwa esibhedlela e-Harry Gwala Regional Hospital eMgu ngundlovu, isithuthwane akukona ukungasebenzi kwengqondo, isifo noma ukugula, futhi asithathelani.
Uchaza uthi isithuthwane ukungasebenzi kwezinzwa okubonakala ngokuphazamiseka kwezinzwa okuphindaphinda izi khawu, ukuquleka noma ukudlikizela, okuhlobene nokubanika okungajwayelekile ebuchosheni.
“Ubuchopho bunamangqamuzana ezinzwa ayizigidigidi (amaneurons) okuyiwona athumela umyalezo ngezimpawu zokubanika nangokwekhe mikhali. Uma kuba khona ukubanika okweqile ngokuzuma okuphazamisa ukusebenza ngokujwayelekile kwamangqamuzana ezinzwa, kungaholela ekudlikizeni.”“Ukudlikizela kanye akusho ukuthi unesithuthwane. Ukuxilongwa ngudokotela kumele kuqinisekise lokhu," kusho yena.
NgokweNhlangano Yesithuthwane eNingi zimu Afrika, ama-80% abantu abanesithuthwane bazokwazi ukulawula ukudlikizela kwabo ngokuphuza imithi.
Izimbangela nokudlikizaImbangela yesithuthwane kubantu abayisithupha kwabayishumi ayaziwa.
 Kulaba abanye abanga ma-40%, singabangelwa ukulimala ekhanda, ukulimala ngesikhathi sokubelethwa, utshwala kanye nokusebenzisa izidakamizwa, ukuguga noma ukuphazamiseka noma ukungalingani kwendlela yokwakheka komzimba noma kwamakhemikhali emzimbeni.
U-Dkt Gumede uthi izimpawu nezinkomba zesithuthwane ziyahluka, futhi zingaziveza ngezindlela ezahlukene, kubandakanya ukudlikiza kwesikhashana (ipetit mal), uma umuntu kuvele kube mnyama amehlo noma agqolozele esikha leni nje; ukudlikizela okubizwa ngetonic-clonic (igrand mal), okujwayele ukuqala ngokuqina komzimba, ngaphambi ko kuthi umuntu awe phansi bese eqala ukudlikizela; kanye namacomplex partial seizures, wona athinta ingxenye yobuchopho. Ipetit mal seizure ithatha imizuzwana embalwa, futhi umuntu kungenzeka anga boni uma iqeda kumubamba. Ngesikhathi kwenzeka igrand mal seizure, loyo muntu angaba nombala oluhlaza okwe sibhakabhaka ngaphandle komlomo, okuyaye kuye ngokuphela uma eseqala futhi ephefumula ngendlela ejwayelekile. Amagrand mal seizures ajwayele ukuthatha imizuzu embalwa.
“Vikela umuntu ukuthi angalimali ngokuqhelisa izinto nangokuqamelisa ikhanda lakhe. Ungamvi mbeli ukuthi anyakaze  noma ufake utho emlonyeni wakhe. Msize ngokuphefumula ngokumlalisa ngecala uma ukudlikiza sekuphelile. Hlala naye aze alulame ngokuphelele."Ngesikhathi secomplex partial seizure, umuntu angabonakala edidekile, ephazamisekile noma edakiwe. Bangaphinde futhi belokhu bephindaphinda ukwenza into, nje ngokuchutha izimpahla abazigqokile. “Qhelisa izinto ezinobungozi bese usiza loyo muntu ukuthi aqhele eduze kobungozi.
Khuluma ngezwi elipholile futhi umnike isiqiniseko,” kusho u-Dkt Gumede.* Ulwazi luhlinzekwe nguMnyango Wezempilo KwaZulu-Natali.
