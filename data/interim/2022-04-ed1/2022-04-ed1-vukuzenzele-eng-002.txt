Vuk’uzenzele 11 April 2022 Edition 1GENERALAll you need to know about epilepsyMost people with epilepsy can live a normal life if they take their medication and the condition is well controlled.
According to Dr Nhlakanipho Gumede, the Clinical Manager of Medical Services at Harry Gwala Regional Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, epilepsy is not a psychological disorder, disease or illness, and it is not contagious.
He explains that epilepsy is a neurological disorder marked by sudden recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness or convulsions, associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
“The brain comprises of billions of nerve cells (neurons) communicating through electrical and chemical signals. When there is a sudden excessive electrical discharge that disrupts the normal activity of the nerve cells, a seizure may result.
“A single seizure does not necessarily mean you have epilepsy. A diagnosis by a medical practitioner needs to confirm this,” he says.
According to Epilepsy South Africa, 80% of people with epilepsy will be able to control their seizures with medication.
Causes and seizuresThe cause of epilepsy in six out of 10 people is not known. In the other 40%, it can be caused by a head injury, injury during the birthing process, alcohol and drug abuse, aging or a metabolic or biochemical disturbance or imbalance.
Dr Gumede says the signs and symptoms of epilepsy vary, and can present in various ways, including generalised absence seizures (petit mal), when a person looks blank and stares; generalised tonicclonic seizures (grand mal), which commonly start with body stiffening, before the person falls down and has jerking movements; and complex partial seizures, which affect a part of the brain.
A petit mal seizure only lasts a few seconds, and the person may be unaware that they had one. During a grand mal seizure, the person may have a blue colour around their mouth, which fades when normal breathing resumes. Grand mal seizures usually last a few minutes.
“Protect the person from injury by moving objects away and cushioning their head. Don’t restrict their movement or put any thing in their mouth. Help breathing by laying the person on their side when the seizure ends. Stay with the person until they have fully recovered.”During a complex partial seizure, the person may appear confused, distracted or drunk. They may also have repetitive movements, such as plucking at their clothes. “Remove harmful objects and guide the person away from danger.
Talk quietly and reassure them,” says Dr Gumede.* Information supplied by the KwaZuluNatal Department of Health.

President concludes North West Imbizo on a high notePresident Cyril Ramaphosa has described his Presidential Imbizo in the North West province as a success after holding a fruitful session with community members.
The imbizo was held recently in Mmabatho Stadium in the Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality  where scores of residents had gathered.
President Ramaphosa interacted with people and listened to their experiences of daily life in the province, service delivery challenges as well as their initiatives and solutions to improve socio-economic conditions.
The President was flanked by a number of his Cabinet Ministers, including Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi, Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele, Minister of Tourism Lindiwe Sisulu, Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu and Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe, among others.
The President told the community members that he had heard their cries and that government will be focusing more on service delivery.
“We had a very fruitful session with the community … the residents were able to raise their concerns and complaints but they also put suggestions forward, and what we need to do better, so I found it very enriching.
“We are going to be focusing more and more on service delivery. Many of the issues that were raised were of a service delivery nature, there was so much enthusiasm that nearly all of them wanted to speak,” the President said.
President Ramaphosa said it had been great to hear people speaking openly and freely as this is what enriches democracy.
The Imbizo also provided an opportunity to inspire new thinking, different ideas, and suggestions on how to fix the challenges that exist.
“I am grateful that the Ministers were present and were able to respond to many of the issues that have been raised.”He said the District Development Model was moving into top gear. “We are going to be utilising it more and more so that as the government we stop working in silos, we must work together in an integrated way.
“I am very pleased that most of the replies that were given here are a clear demonstration that we are now becoming more and more integrated and we are going to address the challenges that our people have faced.”  The President told the community members that government will focus more on service delivery and the Ministers would return to the area with a number of programmes focusing on what needs to be done.– SAnews.gov.za
