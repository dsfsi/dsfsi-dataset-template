Vuk’uzenzele4July 2022 Edition 2Monkeypox in South Africa HEALTHHealth Minister Dr Joe Phaahla has confirmed that Monkeypox has been detected in South Africa during a recent media briefing in Pretoria, Gauteng.
He said he received a report from the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) that they have confirmed Monkeypox in South Africa through laboratory tests.
The virus has been detected in Gauteng and the Western Cape.
Monkeypox is usually a mild disease manifesting as blisters or sores on the skin. It is usually mild and with a fatality rate of 1 percent.
The disease has previously been reported in African countries such as Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Ghana in the early 2000s.
The current outbreak is dominated by high numbers in Europe with the UK leading with over 700 cases, Spain with just over 500, followed by Germany, Portugal and France.
The Minister said the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) is conducting online in-service training for health workers to be able to detect the disease so that necessary laboratory tests can be done.“The disease only spreads through close contact, so you cannot get it by being in the same room with an infected person,” the Minister said.
Minister Phaahla assu red South Africans that Monkeypox is not a virus which has never been seen before and scientists have information about it.
Chairperson of the Minis-terial Advisory Committee (MAC) on COVID-19 and Executive member of NHLS, Professor Koleka Mlisana, said Monkeypox is a disease that is endemic in Central and Northern Africa which has been known to be mild.
An endemic disease is a condition regularly found among particular people or in a certain area.She said there are simila rities between Monkeypox and Smallpox.
“There are vaccines and treatment available for Monkeypox. The disease presents itself with flu like symptoms and Legionnaires. The important thing is that somebody who comes up with a clinical picture is easy to diagnose and most importantly it is difficult to transmit, unlike a respiratory virus, because it is by contact. You would only get it when you have come in direct contact with somebody who is infected,” she said.
Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia.
Professor Mlisana said contact tracing is important in this case and the Health Department will continue to do that.
She assured South Africans that the Laboratory infrastructure has all the adequate resources to be able monitor any new infections that may arise.

The regulations were promulgated by the Minister on 4 May in the Regulations Relating to the Surveillance and the Control of Notifiable Medical Conditions. President Cyril Ramaphosa in a national address in April said the regulations would be eased gradually.
The gazetting of the regulations means that the wearing of face masks in any public-use indoor space or when on public transport is no longer required.
On gatherings, people congregating in public spaces will no longer be limited to certain numbers.
The regulations stipulated that a maximum of 50% of the venue capa city may be occupied, provided that every attendee must be vaccinated against COVID-19 and produce a valid vaccination certificate.
Alternatively, they could produce a valid certificate of a negative COVID-19 test obtained not more than 72 hours before the date of the gathering.
Regarding limitations on people entering the country, the regulations required that any person entering the country be vaccinated against COVID-19 and produce a valid vaccination certifi cate.
Alternatively, this group of people needed to produce a valid certificate of a negative PCR COVID19 test not older than 72 hours before the date of departure.
Minister Phaahla reminded South Africans of the importance of vaccinating for COVID-19.
“We just need to end with caution that the COVID-19 virus is not yet gone; it is still in our midst; we are just stron ger than before, especially with vaccination, and we urge those not yet vaccinated to come forward and those due for boosters to also come forward,” he said.
The Minister added that the vaccination program will remain and is now being integrated into normal health services.
“We urge all leaders of society and organisers of events to work with our health workers to promote healthy lifestyle and know your status, which is blood pressure, blood sugar, cancer, HIV and COVID-19.” –SAnews.
