Notes:
- From 2012-10-ed1 to 2005, there are no available PDFs. There is only the provided printer friendly version.
  These will be downloaded and pushed if requested.

- There are missing files in some of the papers.
  These have been accounted for with a readme file in each folder and what file is missing. 

- January and December often share the same papers.
- January and December also have 1 edition unlike most of the files.
- From 2015-03-ed1, going backwards, there are only english versions available and no other translated language
