Vukuzenzele Unnamed

Motorists who applied for a new or renewal driver’s licence card or professional driving permit (PrDP) between October and December last year are being urged to collect them.
According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), only 42% of the 32 748 driver’s licence cards produced during this time have been collected.
Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula opened the RTMC licensing centres in Midrand and Eco Park last year, in response to the backlog of expired driver’s licences due to COVID-19.The Driver’s Licence Card Account, which prints the licences, is working around the clock to fast-track production and remains on course to clear the backlog by the end of June.
The RTMC says people can check the status of their application before going to the testing centre to collect it.
This can be done by SMS or online.
