# Sentence Aligment using LASER by facebook_research

## Background

This folder stores the modules and scripts to perform sentence alignment using LASER encoded sentences and basic one-to-alignment.   
The encoded and basic output data is stored in `data/sentence_align_output` and `data/simple_align_output` respectively.

## File Structure

```

```

## Overview of logic used

In `main.py`, the general steps to perform the SA task are as follows:
1.  Config LASER using the config script
2.  Build a big filepath dictonary to ref all the data easily  
    2.1   Throughout embedding and tokenisation the file structure of the raw data is kept intact to maintain links between the data
3. Embed the data in data/processed and write to data/embed
4. Tokenise the data in data/processed and write to data/tokenised
5. Perform sentence alignment using the embeddings and write to csv in data/sentence_align_output
6. Perform basic sentence alignment using one to one alignment of tokenised sentences and write to csv in data/simple_align_output

The code has extensive documentation & comments, so this README is relatively short.
